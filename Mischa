I am Mischa, I was born and raised in Otautahi Te Waipounamu in 1975. After leaving School and dabbling in study as a chef I took off to South America, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay then on to Europe. London  became my base for several years from 2000. I chefed and lived and traveled around Western Europe
